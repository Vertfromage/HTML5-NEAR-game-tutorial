# HTML5-NEAR-game-tutorial
Beginners NEAR 7 part Tutorial Series for HTML5 Games.  [ Under Construction ]

Overview: A progressive 7 part tutorial including the basic functionalities that a student or developer would want to know to implement NEAR functionality in their HTML5 games using Assembly script for contract examples.

Who it's for: Students (high school/university level) who have some familiarity with coding games who want to learn how to use NEAR in their games. They might not be familiar with node js, npm, typescript, assemblyscript, rust or even have a basic understanding of how block chain works.

Goals:

-   Each tutorial should build on the last tutorial, assuming only the knowledge contained in the previous tutorials.
-   The tutorial should include each step, explained as simply as possible.
-   Any steps that have fully developed tutorials already available should link to that tutorial. Example: setting up a testnet account.
-   Any code should be either visible on the page to be copied and pasted where need or linked to from the page, and fully commented.
-   The game code will be as simple as possible to not distract from the purpose of the tutorial, ideally the user should be able to swap out the tutorial game code with their own code easily.
-   'How' is prioritized over 'why' so as to not overwhelm with too much information. Inline why sections should be hidden until clicked on, then expand for the user.

At the end of each tutorial should be an optional further reading section to expand on any technologies/concepts that were quickly introduced in the tutorial to encourage further understanding.
